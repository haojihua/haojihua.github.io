				<h2 class="ui dividing header" id="EarlyEarthSurface">Early Earth Surface Environment</h2>

				<p>
				Geochemical environments on the early Earth (before the Great
				Oxidation Event, GOE) are crucially important for the origin and
				evolution of life. Previous studies through various proxies or
				simulations, such as detrital minerals, sulfur isotope
				fractionations, paleosols and other sedimentary records, and
				atmospheric models, have provided various constraints on the redox
				state of the surface environment in the Archean. However, the
				consistency of these results and the corresponding surface
				geochemical progresses, e.g., weathering and river water chemistry,
				is not addressed yet. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Together with my JHU advisor Dimitri
				Sverjensky and GL mentor Robert Hazen, I examined the consistency
				between various lines of evidence on the redox state of the Archean
				surface environment through our thermodynamic calculations on
				stability of detrital minerals. We found H2,g instead of O2,g is the
				more reasonable redox proxy before the GOE (Hao et al., accepted). 
				With the redox level controlled by pH2,g, We developed
				thermodynamic models to simulate the weathering and river chemistry
				on the late Archean (Hao et al., 2017a). With the
				framework of Archean weathering and riverine transport, we have
				studied the speciation and mobility of nutrients and trace metals on
				the Archean (Hao et al., 2017b). Our study can provide
				important implications on various geochemical processes on the
				Archean surface environment, such as the formation of paleosols,
				stability of detrital minerals, whiffs of oxygen recorded by
				abnormal enrichments of trace metals and their isotopic
				fractionations, and haze formations. 
				</p>
				<p>
				After graduation, I continued working on simulating weathering of nutrients and
				transition metals under the early Earth conditions. Together with my collaborator,
				we linked the availability of Co with bio-function of Co-enzymes through the geological
				history (Moore, Hao, et al., 2018).
				</p>
				<p>
				This model will be modified to study water-rock interactions under various T-P and/or
				redox conditions. Moreover, water-rock interactions in other planets, such as the early
				Mars, will be simulated to be compared with geological observations.
				</p>
				
				<h2 class="ui dividing header" id="HighTP">High T-P Aqueous Geochemistry</h2>

				<p>Solubility and speciation of trace metals in the crustal fluids
				at elevated temperatures and pressures are one of the controlling factors for the habitability
				of life in hydrothermal systems. This research could also provide some implications for
				the effects of diagenesis and metamorphism on preservation of depositional signals in 
				sedimentary records. During my thesis research, I have studied the dissolution and speciation 
				of Cr in the aqueous environments at elevated T-P and found that aqueous Cr(II) could be 
				dominant species under hydrothermal and subduction-zone conditions (Hao et al., in preparation).
				Further works will explore other interesting elements including phosphorus, vanadium, and selenium.</p>

				<p>1. Interaction between mineral surfaces and organic molecules</p>
				<p>In the summer of 2013, I started a series of batch adsorption
					experiment in the Surface Lab, Geophysical Laboratory as the predoctoral fellow
					working with Dr. Cecile Fuille and Dr. Robert Hazen. I
					investigated the adsorption of amino acids onto various mineral 
					surfaces including pyrite and magnetite to explore the concentration
					effects for biomolecules through adsorption onto mineral surfaces. 
					Since December, 2016, I started working on the adsorption of nucleotides onto
					clay minerals at Lyon, France under various T-P conditions under the supervision
					of Prof. Isabelle Daniel at University of Lyon1 and École normale supérieure de Lyon.
					Together with colleagues at Lyon, I conducted adsorption experiment of nucleotides at
					elevated temperature and pressure using our newly designed facility.
					In January, 2017, I mentored an undergraduate intern of Ens Lyon together with Isabelle.
					I designed a project for the intern student to examine the roles of divalent transition 
					metals which are presumably abundant in the primitive seawater due to the water-ultramafic 
					rock interaction under the reducing and acidic conditions, in the adsorption of nucleotides 
					onto clay minerals. We conducted the experiment together and found the presence of transition 
					metals, Zn and Ni, could significantly increase the adsorption of nucleotides on clay surface 
					compared with traditionally used alkali and alkaline earth salts environment (Na, Ca, Mg). 
					Our manuscript just got accepted in ACS Earth and Space Chemistry (Hao et al., 2019).</p>
				<p>Right now, I'm conducting experiment to test if this enhancing adsorption by transition metals
					is true or not onto non-swelling clay minerals. Also, the experimental system at elevated
					temperatures and pressures relevant with hydrothermal conditions is also investigated.</p>
					
				
				<p>2. Stability of organic compounds in hydrothermal environment</p>
				<p>While doing the predoc in Geophysical Lab, I conducted 
					hydrothermal experiments using teflon autoclave reactors to study the stability of 
					amino acids under simulated hydrothermal conditions. We focused on exploring the effects of
					aqueous cations and mineral surfaces in naturally hydrothermal environmnets on the
					thermal stability of amino acids at elevated temperatures and pressures.</p>
				
				
				<p>3. Partitioning behavior of amino acids in planetary aqueous environments</p>
				<p>Since December, 2016, I worked with Isabelle and three intern students from Ens Lyon on 
				measuring the partitioning coefficients of amino acids in ice Ih and high-pressure phases. 
				We found that non-negligible amounts of glycine, alanine, proline, and phenylalanine could be 
				incorporated into ice Ih during the equilibrium freezing. These results invalidate the hypothesis 
				that massive freezing of primitive ocean could concentrate amino acids in the remaining fluids, but 
				support the extraterrestrial transport of amino acids by icy comets. Moreover, we found that 
				incorporation of amino acids into high-pressure phases of ice (VI and VII) could favor the 
				crystallization of aqueous fluid which may have some implications for the mantle structure of icy 
				moons and large ocean exo-planets. The results of ice Ih have been accepted for publication in 
				Astrobiology (Hao et al., 2018).</p>
				<p>Right now, I'm preparing a manuscript on the partitioning of biomolecules into high-pressure
				ices under conditions relevant with the icy mantle of exoplanets (Hao et al., in preparation).</p>
					
				<h2 class="ui dividing header" id="Thertools">Thermodynamics-theories and tools</h2>

				<p>1. Thermodynamic properties of the minerals and aqueous species</p>
				<p>Based on early works by Sverjensky & Molling (1992, Nature), I 
					and collaborators further developed the Linear 
					Free Energy Relationship (LFER) method to estimate the Gibbs 
					free energies of isostructural, end-member silicate and oxide 
					minerals (Hao et al., 2017a).</p>
				<p>2. Thermodynamic model of surface complexation and adsorption</p>
				<p>Since October 2016, I started getting training on 
					modeling surface complexation and adsorption in JHU with Prof.
					Dimitri Sverjensky. Future study includes applying this method 
					to simulate adsorption experiment results at elevated temperatures and pressures.</p>
