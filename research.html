				<h2 class="ui dividing header" id="EarlyEarthSurface">Early Earth Surface Environment</h2>

				<p>
				Geochemical environments on the early Earth (before the Great
				Oxidation Event, GOE) are crucially important for the origin and
				evolution of life. Previous studies through various proxies or
				simulations, such as detrital minerals, sulfur isotope
				fractionations, paleosols and other sedimentary records, and
				atmospheric models, have provided various constraints on the redox
				state of the surface environment in the Archean. However, the
				consistency of these results and the corresponding surface
				geochemical progresses, e.g., weathering and river water chemistry,
				is not addressed yet. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Together with my JHU advisor Dimitri
				Sverjensky and GL mentor Robert Hazen, I examined the consistency
				between various lines of evidence on the redox state of the Archean
				surface environment through our thermodynamic calculations on
				stability of detrital minerals. We found H2,g instead of O2,g is the
				more reasonable redox proxy before the GOE (Hao et al., submitted to
				Geobiology). With the redox level controlled by pH2,g, We developed
				thermodynamic models to simulate the weathering and river chemistry
				on the late Archean (Hao et al., 2017a). With the
				framework of Archean weathering and riverine transport, we have
				studied the speciation and mobility of nutrients and trace metals on
				the Archean (Hao et al., 2017b). Our study can provide
				important implications on various geochemical processes on the
				Archean surface environment, such as the formation of paleosols,
				stability of detrital minerals, whiffs of oxygen recorded by
				abnormal enrichments of trace metals and their isotopic
				fractionations, and haze formations. 
				</p>
				<p>
				This model will be
				extended to study water-rock interactions under various T-P and/or
				redox conditions.

				<h2 class="ui dividing header" id="HighTP">High T-P Aqueous Geochemistry</h2>

				<p>Speciation of trace metals in the aqueous fluids usually
					controls the dissolution/formation of their housing-minerals,
					especially at high T-P. This research is also important to
					understand how diagenesis and metamorphism will affect the
					preservation of various signals in sedimentary records. Under the
					supervision of Dimitri Sverjensky, I have studied the dissolution
					and speciation of Cr in the aqueous environments at elevated T-P
					(Hao et al., submitted to Geochemical Perspectives Letters). Further 
					works will cover other interesting elements.</p>

				<p>1. Interaction between mineral surfaces and organic molecules</p>
				<p>Since the summer in 2013, I started some batch adsorption
					experiment in the Surface Lab, Geophysical Laboratory. I
					investigated the adsorption of amino acids onto various mineral 
					surfaces.</p>
					
				
				<p>2. Stability of organic compounds in hydrothermal environment</p>
				<p>While doing the predoc in Geophysical Lab, I conducted 
					hydrothermal experiments to study the stability of amino acids
					under simulated hydrothermal conditions. The role of interesting
					ions and mineral surfaces were explored.</p>
					
					
				<h2 class="ui dividing header" id="Thertools">Thermodynamics-theories and tools</h2>

				<p>1. Thermodynamic properties of the minerals and aqueous species</p>
				<p>Based on early works by Sverjensky & Molling (1992, Nature), I 
					and collaborators further developed the Linear 
					Free Energy Relationship (LFER) method to estimate the Gibbs 
					free energies of isostructural, end-member silicate and oxide 
					minerals (Hao et al., 2017a).</p>
				<p>2. Thermodynamic model of surface complexation and adsorption</p>
				<p>Since October 2016, I started getting training on 
					modeling surface complexation and adsorption in JHU with Prof.
					Dimitri Sverjensky. Future study includes applying this method 
					to model adsorption experiment results under various conditions.</p>
